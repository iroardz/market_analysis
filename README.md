# Market analysis
The dashboard below shows the market analysis for chicken meat in Mexico with public information from the establishments in the country, as well as the expenditure and income of the population. The information is in Spanish because the client is Mexican but you will find a small summary of each sheet below.

In this dashboard, we can find information on the economic units in the Mexican territory and thus be able to find the points of possible sale of chicken.
